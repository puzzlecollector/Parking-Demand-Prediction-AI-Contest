# Parking-Demand-Prediction-AI-Contest

[Competition Link](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235745/overview/description)

Dataset is structured. Will try various models ranging from gradient boosted trees to simple NNs. 

It appears that the data needs a lot of cleaning and preprocessing. And looking at the forums, there are some crtical erros in the data too. 

There is about 8 days left for this contest. And external data is allowed, but I won't bother with gathering more data for now.
